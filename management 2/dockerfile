# We use a specific Maven version that includes Java 21 to ensure consistency.
FROM maven:3.9.6-eclipse-temurin-21 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Maven project file first to leverage Docker layer caching
COPY pom.xml .

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY src ./src

# Run the Maven package command to build the executable JAR file.
# We skip the tests during the build process for faster deployments.
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Create the final, lightweight runtime image
# We use a minimal Java 21 runtime for a smaller and more secure container.

# Copy the executable JAR file from the 'build' stage

EXPOSE 8080

# The command to run the application when the container starts
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
